# sca-playground

I will publish here materials (e.g. source code) that are related to my
learning of side channel attacks.

My random thoughts, plans and progress can be seen on
[wiki](https://github.com/gnull/sca-playground/wiki).

## FILES

* [strcmp-attack](strcmp-attack) - my code to estimate correlations between input of `strcmp` and its execution time
* [bernstein-attack-2005](bernstein-attack-2005) - materials of cache timing attack made by Daniel J. Bernstein with my modifications
